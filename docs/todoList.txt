Done so far
---------------------
- setup gRPC, freud and a basic infrastructure to work on (VMs, repo, ...)
- basic toy example with gRPC
- basic hardcoded instrumentation on the example
- add parameter-dependant complexity (loop 10 RPC calls and malloc)
- print memory usage and execution timestamps
- produce performance traces (txt files with timestamps)
- associate server-side executions with an ID to send to the client
- optimize compilation and installation, add cross-platform instructions
- dockerize the server to easily have it running permanently [non-essential]
- improve instrumentation functions to pass feature object (key/value)

---------------------
TODO for next step

- improve performace traces format to make it compatible with freud-statistics
- develop a reader tool to "decrypt" the traces (with flag for human-readable stamps) [non-essential]
- develop a tool to merge the performance logs from client and server
- start on the report template

---------------------
TODO for long-term

- identify some third-party non-trivial distributed applications and analyze them
- write the report, prepare the poster and presentation 
- have a pizza

---------------------
TODO in the next meeting

- check on improved merge tool
- look into formatting the output for freud
- demo
