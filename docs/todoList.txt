Done so far
---------------------
- setup gRPC, freud and a basic infrastructure to work on (VMs, repo, ...)
- basic toy example with gRPC
- basic hardcoded instrumentation on the example
- add parameter-dependant complexity (loop ~10 RPC calls and malloc)
- print memory usage and execution timestamps
- produce performance traces (txt files with timestamps)
- associate server-side executions with an ID to send to the client
- optimized compilation and installation, added cross-platform instructions

---------------------
TODO for next step

- improve performace traces
- develop a tool to merge the performance logs from client and server
- start on the report template

---------------------
TODO for long-term

- integrate said unified trace in the existing statistics tool (freud-statistics)
- identify some third-party non-trivial distributed applications and analyze them
- write the report, prepare the poster and presentation 
- have a pizza

---------------------
TODO in the next meeting

- see new assignment (deadline: apr 11) with tasks list and graph
- check on improved instrumentation and merge tool prototype
