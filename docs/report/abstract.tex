    Freud is a software performance analysis tool that derives performance annotations
    from measurements of software systems, which can be processed to deduce how well a system is performing. 
    The goal of Jung - this project - is to extend it to 
    instrument and collect data from a distributed system. This means augmenting 
    the existing implementation to be able to collect data from the distributed components 
    through a communication framework and link it using causal relations.
    The resulting library could therefore be used to monitor Remote Procedure Calls, web servers with
    database queries and much more to quickly identify the potential points of improvement.
