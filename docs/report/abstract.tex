    Freud \cite{freud} is a software performance analysis tool that derives performance annotations
    from measurements of running systems. The goal of this project is to extend Freud to 
    instrument and collect data from a distributed software system. This means augmenting 
    the existing implementation to be able to link the data collected over distributed components 
    using causal relations.
